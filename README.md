Scoops
=========

This is heavily modified version of Scoops with most features removed,
this may not be of much use to you.

However it may be good if you have specific use-case similar to mine:
* You have stack of fragments, every one of which should be style in different colors
* As you navigate up and down in fragment backstack the style should change accordingly
* You want the color change to be smooth
